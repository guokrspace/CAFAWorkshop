# CAFAWorkshop

## Beirithm - Hutong
* 1. The idea is to follow a navigational algorithm to navigate the Hutong in Beijing and interview the local people in the Hutong. When they express an positive feeling about their lift, we will record and turn left on next turn, and vice versus. Once the data is recorded, it will send to the server and store there.

* 2. In the meantime, there are bird house in the exhibition hall as an art installistion, those bird houses are connnected with  an Arduino Open Source Hardward, which will generate bird sounds mimicking "happy" or "sad" bird sound. 

* 3. To bridge 1) and 2), A computer runing processing proram will go online to read the data store in the server describled above, if there is a "negative" feeling recorded, it will sends data to the Arduino to trigger a negative type of sound, otherwise, it trigger an positive sound.
