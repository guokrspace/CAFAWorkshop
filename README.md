# CAFAWorkshop

## Beirithm - Hutong
* 1. The idea is to follow an algorithm to navigate the Hutong and interview the local people we meet there. During the interview, if they express an positive feeling about their life, we take a note of "Positive Mood", later on, when we continue to walk in the Hutong, we will turn left on next turn, otherwise, if they expressed a negative feeling about their lift, we take a note of "Negative Mood" and turn right on next turn. This data will also be sent to server and store there.

* 2. In the meantime, there are bird houses in the exhibition hall as an art installistion, those bird houses are connnected with an Arduino Open Source Hardward, which will generate bird sounds mimicking "happy" or "sad" bird sound. 

* 3. The bridge 1) and 2) is computer runing processing proram will go online to read the data store in the server describled above, if there is a "negative" feeling recorded, it will sends data to the Arduino to trigger a negative type of sound, otherwise, it trigger an positive sound.
